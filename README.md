🟩 Off-Track-Media Studios

Building Empires, Not Just Brands.

Off-Track-Media (OTM) is a digital-first production studio headquartered in Western Australia.
We create original IP, cinematic content, high-performance tooling, and automated operating frameworks that allow small teams to operate at enterprise scale.

OTM is built on Kernel 1.1 — our internal engineering standard that enforces:

Zero-placeholder code

Mandatory preflights

Snapshot/rollback systems

Dry-run safety

Full auditability

Infrastructure-level determinism

Kernel 1.1 is our public guarantee: everything we release meets a minimum standard of technical and operational excellence.

🔧 Why Kernel 1.1 Matters

Kernel 1.1 is our internal execution framework, and every script, pipeline, and automation we produce is bound to it.

It guarantees:

🛡 Safety First

Mandatory OS checks

Package manager validation

Network checks

Permission validation

🔄 Rollback & Snapshots

Full snapshot of key config directories

Instant rollback on failure

Auto-generated rollback helper scripts

🧪 Dry-Run as Default

Every destructive action previewed

Nothing modifies the system without explicit confirmation

📝 Audit-Quality Output

Clean logs

Transparent operations

No silent side effects

🚫 Zero Placeholders

No TODOs.
No “fill this out later.”
No half implementations.
If something can’t be safely done, we say it.

📚 Our Governance & Compliance

Off-Track-Media operates under a compliance-first model, using:

Apache 2.0 Licensing

Full NOTICE files

Code of Conduct & Governance docs

Operational security policies

Audit-ready workflow documentation

Project-level version locking

Kernel 1.1 execution guarantees

We don’t “patch things later.”
Everything ships complete.

To redefine what independent creators are capable of by merging artistic discipline with hardened engineering.
